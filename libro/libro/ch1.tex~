\section{Existence problems}
We begin with some metamathematics.
All problems about the existence of maps can be cast into one of the
following two forms, which are in a sense mutually dual.

\noindent
{\bf The Extension Problem}\index{extension problem} \    %%% NB index entry tag
Given an inclusion $ A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} X $, and a map
$ A \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} Y $,
does there exist a map $f^{\dagger}:X\to Y$ such that
$f^{\dagger}$ agrees with $f$ on $A$?

Here the appropriate source category for maps should be clear from the
context and, moreover, commutativity through a
candidate $f^{\dagger}$ is precisely
the restriction requirement; that is,
$$f^{\dagger}   :  f^{\dagger}\circ i = f^{\dagger}|_A = f\,. $$
If such an $f^{\dagger}$ exists\footnote{${}^{\dagger}$ suggests striving
for perfection, crusading}, then it is called an {\bf
extension}\index{extension!of a map|bi} of $f$ and is said to {\bf
extend}\index{extend|bi} $f$. In any diagrams, the presence of
a dotted arrow or an arrow carrying a ? indicates a pious hope, in no way
begging the question of its existence. Note that we shall usually
omit $\circ$ from composite maps.

\noindent
{\bf The Lifting Problem}\index{lifting problem} \
Given a pair of maps $E \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}B$ and $X \stackrel{f}
{\rightarrow} B $,
does there exist a map $f^{\circ} : X \to E$, with
$pf^{\circ} = f  $?


That {\em all\/} existence problems about maps are essentially of one
type or
the other from these two is seen as follows. Evidently, all existence problems
are representable by triangular diagrams\index{triangular diagrams} and it
is easily seen that there are only these six possibilities:
